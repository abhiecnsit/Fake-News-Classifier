# Fake-News-Classifier
An NLP classifier which classifies news as fake or real  using Tf-idf and Count_Vectorizer techniques.

In this notebook I have made a fake news classifier which uses Tf-idf and Count Vectorizer to generate features and then makes classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 
## What's New
In this notebook I have used Kaggle's API to download the datasets. To use the API you first need to install the API using: pip install kaggle. After the installation go to your Kaggle profile and under 'Account' tab select "Create API token", a json file will download. Please select the json file location: C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json.

I highly recommend to please visit the [Kaggle API page](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) for detailed explanation and more functionalities. 

The dataset is available on Kaggle's [Fake News Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data#) and you can find the details regarding the Kaggle API [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).
